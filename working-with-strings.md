# Working with strings

Besides numbers, booleans and time values, Deci also has strings. A string is nothing more than a piece of text.

## Declaring a string

You can declare a string value by placing text between quotation marks ("):

```deci live
"Hello world!"
```

## Joining two strings

You can join two strings by using the `+` operator like this:

```deci live
a = "Hello "
b = "World!"
a + b
```
