# Functions for numbers

Deci has a bunch of built-in functions that operate on numbers. They are:

## abs

This function gives you the absolute value of a number. If the given number is positive or zero, it gives you that number. If it's negative, it gives you the number multiplied by `-1`.

```deci live
abs(-10 days)
==> 10 days
```

## ln

`ln (number)` gives you [the natural logarithmic of a number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm):

```deci live
ln(12 steps)
==> 2.4849 steps
```

## sqrt

This function gives you the square root of a number:

```deci live
sqrt(9 meters^2)
==> 3 meters
```
