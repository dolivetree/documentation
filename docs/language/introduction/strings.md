# Strings

A string is a data type used to represent text.

## Declaring a string

You can declare a string value by placing text between quotation marks ("):

```deci live
"Hello world!"
==> 'Hello world!'
```

## Joining two strings

You can join two strings by using the `+` operator like this:

```deci live
A = "Hello "
B = "World!"
A + B
==> 'Hello World!'
```
