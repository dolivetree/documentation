# Functions

A function is a block of reusable Decipad language used to perform a set of operations.

Deci has a series of built-in functions that you can call. Some of them you've seen, like the `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operators, or the comparison operators like `==` or `>=`.

Other functions include mathematical functions such as `abs` or `ln`.

This is how you call a function in Decipad:

```deci live
Time = -10 days
TimeSpan = abs(Time)
==> 10 days
```

## Functions on numbers
